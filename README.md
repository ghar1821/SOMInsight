# SOMInsight
Algorithm for computing discriminative temporally dynamic immune features from temporal cytometry data.

Some refactoring of the code in `experimental_material/sominsight` is required to tidy up the modules. 
Currently, it contains some contents that are pertinent to the HCMV dataset used in the thesis.

Hence please stay tuned for the SOMInsight algorithm package!
